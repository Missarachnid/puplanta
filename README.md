###  A website set up to prove my ability to serve it from AWS

####  This is a WIP, check back for updates
####  I am building an api to deal with the store locations. This is such a large amount of data that it would take several requests sent to the google places/maps api to complete the page. I would have to pay for all those requests. Since I could not find an existing api that had all the pet stores in the ~60 mi radius of Atlanta, I am gathering data to create one. This means this project will take a little longer, but then if I wanted to turn this project into a "real" site I will have the capablility.

###  Technology Used:
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  JavaScript/React
*  Google Maps API
*  Amazon S3/Route 53
